## About the Video Course
Hyper-V is Microsoft's hardware virtualization product and it will let you create and run software on a virtual machine. It’s more cost effective in most scenarios, because it more efficiently utilizes physical server resources.

In this course, you’ll see how to implement Hyper-V to reduce software licensing costs and free up your staff time. You’ll see how to install the Windows Server 2019 Hyper-V role and deploy virtual networks, virtual hard drives, and virtual machines. 

Moving on, you’ll discover the best practices for a virtual machine and virtual hard drive storage. We’ll give you detailed guidance on how to attain high performance by leveraging Hyper-V virtual network adapter features and virtual machine configuration. 

By the end of this course, you’ll have learned how to deploy a Windows Server 2019 Hyper-V server. You’ll deploy and configure virtual switches, virtual hard drives, and virtual machines.
